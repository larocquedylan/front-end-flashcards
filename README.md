# Front end flashcards app

The idea is: There are 11 essential questions for front end that I have in mind. 

I want a way to practice them. So I am building an app that prompts me and give a text field to write out my answer. I want to use my openAI api keys to then have the thing judge my answer. 

Could this be done with chatGPT? yes. 

But this seems more interesting to get some experience with their API.
